The home page shows all coffee listed in your menu.
Use the API provided below to get the list of all Coffee.
Each item should show type of coffee, image, price and add to bucket button.

Show a bucket count in div to show how many items in the bucket, on top RHS.
Items added to the bucket will be stored in LocalStorage so that you can retrieve them and show them on bucket.html page.
Create a bucket.html where users can see their order and total bucket value. Show total price in div as shown in sample submission.
